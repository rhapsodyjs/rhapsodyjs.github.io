RhapsodyJS is a HMVC framework that runs on top of Express 4, it also auto-generate, in build time, a RESTful API with your Models.

Browse the documentation to understand any the features, and see the [example projects](https://github.com/rhapsodyjs/RhapsodyJS-examples).

It's kinda simple, because it's the first documentatin, but I hope you find it useful and like the framework! =)

## Install RhapsodyJS

To install RhapsodyJS, you must run the command:

This will generate the basic structure of your app
