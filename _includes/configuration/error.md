In the `app/config/error` folder you will find three files.

In the `error.js` you will have the handler for errors 404 and 500.
They come with a default behavior, but you can change it.

The code for Error 500 fill run when a uncaught exception happen in your app, so take care on it! =)

The other files are the views of the pages of error 404 and 500, you can also change it.
